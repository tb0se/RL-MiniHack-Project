# RL-MiniHack-Project

## Getting started
Setting up the environment

1. Setting up conda environment(Recommended)
    * Create a new environment from `environment.yml` file:
        ```
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        ```
        The environment name is set in the first line of the `yml` file.
    * Activate the new environment
        ```
        conda activate MINIHACK_ENV
        ```
    * Verify new environment was installed correctly
        ```
        conda env list
        ```
Note: The environment has the [nle package](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle) installed using conda([instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle/issues/246)).
